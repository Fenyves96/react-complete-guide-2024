This is a repository about a react course to help my learning with notes and commits.

# Theory
## What is react js?
It is JavaScript a library for building user interfaces.
## Why would you use it?
Uses javascript in the browser without reloading the page. Using just javascript is hard, react helps to focus on writing features instead of useless framework specific knowledge. 
React is a **Declarative** UI Programming framework which means it defines the goal not the steps on the other hand JavaScript is an **Imperative** language: it defines the steps, not the goal. In react you can write HTML code.

# Refresh JavaScript Knowledge
- defer keyword provides that javascript files will be executed after all html elements loaded (you can do the same thing if you put sciript section in the end of the body section)
- type="module" provides to use import syntax
