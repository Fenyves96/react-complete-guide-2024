## What is react js?

It is JavaScript a library for building user interfaces.

## Why would you use it?

Uses javascript in the browser without reloading the page. Using just javascript is hard, react helps to focus on writing features instead of useless framework specific knowledge.
React is a **Declarative** UI Programming framework which means it defines the goal not the steps on the other hand JavaScript is an **Imperative** language: it defines the steps, not the goal. In react you can write HTML code.
In react script tags will be automatically generated by React, beacuse **React Project Uses a Build Process**

## How react works?

It uses JSX files (JavaScript Sytax extension) which are used to describe & create HTML elements in JavaScript in a declarative way. (browsers dont support this file!)
These files declare a react **Component**. (ex: App.JSX)

If you inspect the html you will see only one specific index.jsx, this is the build code.
ReactDOM library render our components. ReactDOM has a createRoot method with an entryPoint parameter. If you make a react project it will be a div with root id.
